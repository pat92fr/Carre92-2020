Thank you everyone for the advice.

The physical checks for safe IMU behaviour on cube black, will only operate with cube Black firmware, and the check in mission planner will only work with cube Black firmware

So when it asks, alway select Cube Black for a ProfiCNC/Hex CubeBlack

I understand that we must select CubeBlack firmware for the newest Cube Blacks for the reasons stated above.

But what about the older Cubes? I am working on two older batches of Cubes (which still have the labels “Pixhawk 2” on them):

1st batch was purchased in late 2016/early 2017
2nd batch was purchased in early 2018
Are the older Cubes supposed to run on the CubeBlack firmware as well? I have tried looking around the forums but couldn’t find an answer to this :slight_smile:
